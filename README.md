# Anomaly detection with quantum machine learning for particle physics data

This repository has the code we developed for the paper _"Quantum anomaly detection in the latent space of proton collision events at the LHC"_ [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10780). In this work, we investigate unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection tasks in particle physics data. 

The `qad` package associated with this work was created for reproducibility of the results and ease-of-use in future studies.

## Documentation 
The documentation for can be consulted in the readthedocs page: **TODO**

## How to install
The package can be installed with Python's `pip` package manager. We recommend installing the dependencies and the package within a dedicated environment. 
**TODO**: try directly `pip install .zip` after the repo is made public. 
```
git clone https://github.com/vbelis/latent-ad-qml.git
cd latent-ad-qml
pip install .
```

## Usage
Examples on how to run the code and use the `qad` to reproduce results and plots from the paper can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/vbelis/latent-ad-qml/tree/main/scripts).
