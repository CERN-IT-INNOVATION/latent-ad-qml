This repository has the code we developed for the paper _"Quantum anomaly detection in the latent space of proton collision events at the LHC"_ [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10780). In this work, we investigate unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection tasks in particle physics data. 

The `qad` package associated with this work was created for reproducibility of the results and ease-of-use in future studies.

The figure above, taken from [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10780), depicts the _quantum\-classical pipeline_ for detecting (anomalous) new-physics events in proton collisions at the LHC. Our strategy, implemented in `qad`, combines a data compression scheme with unsupervised quantum machine learning models to assist in scientific discovery at high energy physics experiments.

## Documentation 
The documentation for can be consulted in the readthedocs [page](https://latent-ad-qml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
## How to install
The package can be installed with Python's `pip` package manager. We recommend installing the dependencies and the package within a dedicated environment. 
You can directly install `qad` by running:

```
pip install https://github.com/vbelis/latent-ad-qml/archive/main.zip
```
or by first cloning the repo locally and then installing the package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbelis/latent-ad-qml.git
cd latent-ad-qml
pip install .
```

## Usage
Examples on how to run the code and use `qad` to reproduce results and plots from the paper can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/vbelis/latent-ad-qml/tree/main/scripts).
